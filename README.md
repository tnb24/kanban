# Kanban Board

The design is taken from [here](https://www.figma.com/file/HbVlYRqVxZPcbuAytZgNuq/Simple-Kanban-Board-(Community)). Created this to brush up and polish my frontend skills.


To Do:

- [x] Implement "This Week" & "Next Week" column
- [x] Make components like Labels & Cards reproducible 
- [x] Small UX changes to make the exp more enjoyable
